## Wanderer

*v0.1* ![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/Ernest314/wanderer.svg?branch=master)

This is a program originally intended for astrophotography use. It continuously
captures a sequence of images from a webcam, which can then later be stacked
to produce an output image.

**Wanderer** is made with Qt.
